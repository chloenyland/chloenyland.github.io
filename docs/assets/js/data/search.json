    "content": "Yesterday I was watching James Scholz’s how I studied for 12 hours a day for over a year Youtube video, and it really inspired me. Late 2024 and the majority of 2025 has not been the best months for me honestly, I don’t know whether to contribute this to post-GCSE burnout, but I’ve just been lazy and not revising or keeping up with my courses at college. However, 2025 is not over yet, I have roughly 4 months left of this year and I’m determined to end 2025 on a positive note. During studying I will not always be motivated, as James Scholz mentions in his video, but hopefully I will have the systems/habits in place for my brain to just do studying. At least, that’s what I’m hoping for. Inspired by James, I’m going to try and study 12 hours a day - I know this is a tough goal and I will not always hit that 12 hour mark every day, but hopefully with systems in place I will be able to average 12 hours a day. Also, I need to incorporate some exercise into this growing routine as well, for the sake of my mental and physical wellbeing. I have less than a year until my A Level exams are upon me, I feel nervous and anxious just thinking about it but as I study more and understand the content of my courses better, I’ll be more confident in myself tackling these exams.  A note that I need to reminded of is to not compare myself with my peers, and remember no matter how inadequate I may feel with the competition of my peers, as long as I put in 100% of my effort towards these exams, I will have done my best and be proud that I have tried. Comparison is the thief of joy. Additionally, after A Levels, I’m going to treat myself and buy some old Pokemon games to play on my Nintendo 3Ds  Starting tomorrow, I will be blogging everyday with how much time I have studied, what I was studying, and some reflections of my day.  “The depth to which you study is far more important than how long you study” - James Scholz, 2021  That’s all for now, thanks for reading~ "
